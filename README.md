This project aims to pulling photos from Facebook account, and let people interact with their photos by face tracking. 
In this stage, I cannot get the authorty from facebook to pull photos, so I just add several photos from random people.

1. cd test
2. python -m SimpleHTTPServer
3. localhost:8000
4. I cannot get access to facebook right now. So I fake a little. Just type localhost:8000/explore.html
